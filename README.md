# badge_check_out
This is a website intended to allow a Security Guard to track who has checked out a badge.

Early versions are done through HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3 and only function on the local webpage.

Using the chrome extension below will allow for overwriting data. For now, a .csv file is downloaded again (and optionally overwritten by using the chrome extension) every time a user checks out, returns a badge, or clicks the Export to .csv button.
